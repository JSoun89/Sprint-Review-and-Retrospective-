#How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpreting the users needs could be done during the feedback received from the team or clients. This helps when trying to impletment changes into a program. Creating user stories help by having the customers feedback regarding the program. This allows the program to become more customer friendly. By doing so, the program continues to improve to achieve all of the customers wants and neeeds. 

#How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

When trying to find the right developing program for a certain project will depend on the clients requirements. For example, the Waterfall Method is used for projects that does not need a lot of flexibility unlike the Agile method. One of the agile processes I hope to incorporate in my future development work is the Kanban system. In my previous job, the Kanban system has worked amazing when trying to keep our stock organized. Which is believe would assist me when I need to work a project that needs a lot of flexibility.  

#What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

I believe in order to be a good team member there needs to be a lot of communication and understanding. Everyone on a team could have different skills, therefore, there is a lot of learning and teaching when on a team. Which is why I believe that actively listening and providing constructive critism is very helpful in a team.
